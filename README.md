Jipange is an application that takes a document containing a timetable as an input and creates entries/events of that timetable in a calendar app.
The app reminds the user of any tasks they need to do. 5 mins prior to the start time for that task. 
This repository contains a sample timetable document that can be used to test the application plus a calendarfx framework that acts as the calendar app.
As for now , the only supported file type is excel and the only supported timetable format is of that attached as a sample (ICS NOV...)
